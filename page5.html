            Greetings to all my fans and supporters around the world.
            It's me, CR7, Cristiano Ronaldo, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the incredible
            journey we've shared.
            I've dedicated my life to the beautiful game of Soccer, and it's been an honor to wear the crown as the king
            of
            the pitch.
